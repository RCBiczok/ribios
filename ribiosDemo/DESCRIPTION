Description: The ribiosDemo package provides prototypes and examples
    demonstrating how to call APIs defined by the BIOS system from R. We hope this
    package assists programmers new to BIOS and/or to R to establish crosstalks
    between two systems. Whoever interested is welcomed to study the source code and
    make contributions.
