Version 1.0-3 (2012-01-31)
  + The cmap function uses ksBoot instead of calling ksStat repeatedly. The ksBoot function is dedicated for KS-statistic bootstrapping;
  + The cmap function changes the bootstrapping by using UNIQUE values of ksScores, in order to deal with large bunch of ties caused by 0s
  + The ksScore function has been re-written in C, making the program about three-times faster.
  
Version 1.0-2 (2012-01-18)
  + cmap returns scores in the descending order
  + Add a prototype Rscript file as command-line tool

Version 1.0-1 (2012-01-10)
  + connScore and connScorePerm has been transformed into S4 methods
  + cmap has been adapted to a matrix input

Version 1.0-0 (2012-01-09)
  + Refactor ks functions from ribiosExpression to ribiosReposition. This package provides low-level functions for computational drug reposition with expression data.
